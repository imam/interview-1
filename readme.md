# Interview application
=======================

This is a simple application that I made for an interview for a startup company in Jakarta. I've done this application in less than 3 hours and I don't change any code inside it so you will see pure application that I made only in 3 hours.

The functionality is simple: To show list of products and retrieve the product in homepage by AJAX.
